## Hi there! 👋
My name is Kirkland, but I go by SENTINELITE online! I've an avid gamer-turned developer. I have a knack for crafting thoughful software that helps people to chase their dreams by making their lives easier. I have a strong focus on performance, UX, & accessiblity. I want to ensure everyone is considered when making software, rather than an after-thought!

This details some of the things I’m currently building — mostly Apple-native apps & creator tools.
